This is a new trial of tensor decomposition for exploring the multidimensional patterns in urban computing.
1. All raw data is in the document 'data'.
2. Planar KDE is done through QGIS, while the Network KDE is done through SANET (please see: http://sanet.csis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/)
The results are put into document 'KDE'
3. Bivariate Moran's I is done based on GeoDa.
4. Regression analysis is done through Python and Rstudio.
The data and code is put into document 'Regression'.
5. Individual and interactive effects of factors is analysed based on Geographical detector (please see: http://www.geodetector.cn/)
The results are put into document 'GeoDetector'.
6. The remained analysis is undertaken based on Python in Spatiotemporal data mining.ipynb.
7. London's car crashes in 2019, 2020 and 2021 are considered.
